# Project Background

Student exam scores are not only determined by sheer willpower or effort alone! Exam scores can be effected by various daily habits, including sleep, diet, social media usage,etc. Why would this be important to consider from a business perspective? Well, in today's economy, the education sector has grown substantially over the past five years alone due to the pandemic. Online education tools and accessibility has made the market very lucrative and by determining which habits affect exam scores more, niche markets for entrepreneurs could be in grasp. Therefore, the effect of student habits on exam scores was the main focus of this project.

# Project Summary

The project focused on determining the main daily habits which exerted the most effect on exam scores of students between 16-24 years of age. The project utilized data obtained from Kaggle and using machine learning models were able to determine which daily habits had the biggest effect on exam scores. The machine learning models utilised in this project include a Linear Regression model and a Decision Tree.

# Project Process

The project started with data cleaning and preparation for the machine learning models utilised in this project.

### Data Collection and Preparation

#### [Data Loading]{.underline}

The data provided was downloaded as student_habits_performance.csv from Kaggle and load using pandas. After loading of the csv file, the necessary libraries were imported and placed in a import_study_libs class. These libraries can be found in the requirements.txt file for replication of the project.

#### [Preparation]{.underline}

The data was prepared by first cleaning then encoding categorical variables. The cleaning process consisted of filling missing values with averages and removing any spacing between words.

### Data Exploration and Model Building

#### [Data Exploration]{.underline}

Data exploration began with statistical analysis consisting of mmmm, mmm, mmm. After statistical analysis, data exploration began by plotting the following plots:

-   Scatter plot

-   Stacked bar plot

-   Violin plot

-   Heatmap

-   Parallel coordinates

-   Radar plot

#### [Model Building]{.underline}

Two machine learning models- Linear Regression and Decision Tree- were built and trained using Sci-Kit learn for this project. The linear regression model were used to predict the exam scores of students when considering factors like 1, 2, 3... Meanwhile, a Decision Tree model was chosen to determine exam scores when 1, 2, 3..
