# Data Collection and Preparation

## Collection of Data:

The data collected for this project is provided by Kaggle and thorough preparation of this data were done for machine learning models.

```{python}
#Importing all necessary programs
def import_study_libs():
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    import seaborn as sns
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import sklearn as sk
    from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
    from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
    from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
    from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
    from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer
    import lime as lime
    import shap as shap
    return {"np":np, "pd":pd, "plt":plt, "load_wine":load_wine, "GridSearchCV":GridSearchCV, "StratifiedKFold":StratifiedKFold,
            "RandomForestClassifier":RandomForestClassifier, "accuracy_score": accuracy_score, "confusion_matrix": confusion_matrix,
            "classification_report":classification_report, "make_scorer": make_scorer}

# Loading the data set
file= "student_habits_performance.csv"
def load_study_data():
    try:
        libs= import_study_libs()
        df= pd.read_csv(file, sep=';', **kwargs)
        dfc=df.columns.str.strip() #To clean up data
        print ("Data Loaded Succesfully!")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print (f"File not found!: {file_path}")
        
```

## Preparation of Data:

Data is prepped by removing missing values, encoding categorical values and normalising numeric variables.

```{python}
# Handle missing Values and duplicates:
def study_clean():
    df_missing= df.fillna(df.mean (numeric_only= True))
    df_duplicates= df_missing.drop_duplicates()
    df_clean= df_duplicates

    print ("Data preprocessed and cleaned!")
    return df_clean
    
    

```

# Data Exploration and Model Building

## Statistical Analysis:

The data was first explored by applied statistical in three ways:

-   Mean study time by Health Tier

-   Correlation between sleep and exam scores

-   Outlier detection

```{python}
# Statistical Analysis
```

## Data Exploration:

Data were explored and the following plots were obtained:

-   Scatter plot

-   Stacked bar plot

-   Box/Violin plots

-   Heatmaps

-   Parallel Coordinates plots

-   Radar Charts

```{python}
# Scatter plot
```

```{python}
#Stacked bar plot
```

```{python}
#Violin plot
```

```{python}
#Heatmap
```

```{python}
#Parallel Coordinates plot
```

```{python}
#Radar Charts
```

## Model Building:

The linear regression model and decision tree model were trained for this project:

##### Linear Regression Model

```{python}

```

##### Decision Tree

```{python}

```
